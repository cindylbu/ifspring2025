                    <b>"If I Ain't Got You"</b> is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Alicia Keys for her second studio album <i>The Diary of Alicia Keys</i> (2003). Inspired by the 2001 death of singer Aaliyah, the September 11 attacks, and other events in the world and in Keys' life, the song is about "how material things don't feed the soul". It was released as the second single from The Diary of Alicia Keys on February 17, 2004, by J Records. The single cover depicts Keys similarly to the subject of Man Ray's 1924 photograph Le Violon d'Ingres <cite>(Wikepedia)</cite>.
